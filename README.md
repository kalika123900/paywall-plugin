# Paywall-plugin


Wordpress Plugin - A paywall is a website feature implemented by digital publishers that requires a value exchange to access subscriber content or experiences. Revenues via paid subscriptions are generally the end goal of publishers, however, paywalls can be used to offer access to content incrementally, by offering an exchange of value. For example, a website could offer a month of access to a user for signing up to an email newsletter, or by agreeing to an ad-lite experience.
